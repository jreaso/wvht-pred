# Waveheight Prediction

Predictics daily maximum observed waveheight on northshore Oahu from offshore buoy data. This project is based on the project: https://github.com/benfreeston/surfline_recruitment_project.

There are two notebooks, one which cleans and processes the data and another which builds a model to predict `Obs`.
